        Throughout history, small groups of people have controlled and made
        decisions that impact the lives of thousands on a daily basis. Even when
        we think we're making our own choices, having control over our destiny
        with endless options for coffee sizes and flavors or being able to study
        virtually any subject online, in reality, we're just a tiny cog in a
        massive machine run by a select few.{" "}

        The power imbalance between those in power and 99% of society is stark.
        Often, even well-intentioned policies lack competence, leaving us to
        foot the bill for mistakes we didn't make. Meanwhile, today's economy is
        so interconnected and fast-paced that a single poorly crafted tweet can
        send markets into freefall!

        Given this context, what can we do to protect ourselves? To push back?
        To level the playing field? To live the good life!

        The rise of web3—powered by public decentralized blockchain technology
        as an infrastructure for global financial systems—is an unstoppable
        revolution! However, navigating uncharted waters without protection
        isn't sustainable for long-term freedom. Self-custody isn't everyone's
        cup of tea—and that's perfectly fine.
