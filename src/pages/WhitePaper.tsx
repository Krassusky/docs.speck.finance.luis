      <p className="mb-4">
        There are cultures that believe in destiny, karma, past lives, and
        divine purpose. Others explain many things simply as chance, luck, or
        the lack thereof. Some mix a little of everything. But none of that
        matters. The fact is that our lives are dramatically impacted and
        influenced by the place where we are born and grow up. Generally, people
        born in rich and developed countries have a significant advantage in
        most aspects of life over those born in less rich and/or less developed
        countries. This conclusion may seem very obvious to people living in
        Latin America, Africa, some regions of Europe, and Asia, but probably
        many North Americans and Western Europeans have never realized the
        economic privilege they possess compared to others. When an American
        visits Brazil, their money multiplies by five, six, seven, or eight
        times. When a German travels to India, the same thing happens. But as
        the Greek Stoics would say, we need to focus our efforts on the things
        we control!{" "}

      <p className="mb-4">
        Since the creation of Bitcoin, the world has never been the same. It is
        the first time in human history that a currency not issued by a central
        bank is used on a global scale. Following this, many others emerged, but
        most importantly: a revolutionary technology, an infrastructure for
        building a new economy, globalized, decentralized, borderless,
        blockchain-based, tokenized! At the time this text is being written, the
        crypto world already moves nearly $3 trillion. All this momentum comes
        with a lot of complexity and risks for the unwary. Operating assets in
        the crypto world is both enchanting and full of opportunities, but it
        can also be very dangerous and simultaneously contribute to the
        accumulation and loss of wealth.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck Finance was created to bring all the economic benefits of the
        crypto world to people from developing countries, allowing them to
        accumulate and multiply international wealth while avoiding risks and
        instabilities caused locally in their countries of origin. Speck is an
        international investment platform that curates the best assets from
        around the world and brings them into the platform in an easy and secure
        way to access, thus enabling people to create asset protection, not
        being entirely at the mercy of decisions made by rulers and geopolitical
        and environmental events in their regions.{" "}
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Overview</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck Finance is an international investment platform that utilizes
        blockchain as its core technology. We have built a regulatory and
        technological infrastructure to facilitate the purchase of the world's
        best assets, focusing on protecting and growing the wealth of
        individuals living in emerging markets, starting with Brazil and
        subsequently expanding to Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Nigeria,
        South Africa, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Turkey,
        Ukraine, and Poland, not necessarily in that order. Our team of
        investment specialists is responsible for monitoring, testing, and
        evaluating the best investment opportunities daily. This enables us to
        efficiently list and create the best financial products, whether with
        Bitcoin, altcoins, tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and DeFi, tailored
        to match the profile of the investor using Speck.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck has its own technological base, but we also partner with major
        entities to offer a seamless solution to all users. In Brazil, we are
        already integrated with local payment methods to provide a very fast and
        secure experience for converting the Brazilian Real into an
        internationally tokenized dollar-denominated product in just a few
        seconds.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Currently, Speck is incorporated and holds licenses to operate via Costa
        Rica, a crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Strategically, Speck
        needs to be outside the countries where it intends to acquire a
        significant user base, precisely to offer a secure alternative for users
        to transfer part of their wealth abroad and avoid local risks. At the
        same time, it is important to comply with all legal requirements to
        operate within the country even while being based outside it, which may
        seem contradictory at first.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Emerging Markets</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, the U.S. dollar was chosen
        as the primary international reserve currency, consolidating American
        hegemony in the world during the 20th century. Since then, the world has
        changed significantly, and what are known as Emerging Markets have
        emerged. These are countries that are showing good growth and
        industrialization rates but still face problems of economic, political
        instability, and a lower per capita income compared to developed
        countries, as well as issues with poverty, education, and income
        distribution. The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and
        South Africa), Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Ukraine, Turkey, Vietnam,
        and Nigeria are part of this group.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In all these countries, the population suffers and sees its purchasing
        power eroded year after year due to inflation and depreciation of the
        local currency. In the figure below, we bring the first example of
        Brazil, which since the post-war period has gone through eight different
        official currencies and only achieved greater stabilization 31 years ago
        with the creation of the Real Plan. Even so, if we analyze the
        purchasing power from 1994 to today, we observe an erosion of 87%:

      <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
        In the second example, we bring a comparison of the Nigerian currency,
        the Naira against the U.S. dollar over the past five years. Starting
        from 2023, an accelerated process of devaluation began. For instance,
        the exchange rate in 2022 was approximately 448 USD/NGN, and by 2023, it
        had risen to around 460 USD/NGN. As of March 2025, the exchange rate has
        further increased to between 1,537 and 1,566 USD/NGN, reflecting a
        significant depreciation of the Naira.

      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
        Our third example is Ukraine, with very high inflation rates over the
        past 10 years:
      </p>

      <img src={Graph3} alt="Inflation3" className="mb-4" />
      <p className="mb-1 text-xs">

        >
          https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/core-infl ation-rate
        </a>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
        We understand that Ukraine is currently a country at war, but we also
        believe that this war is a significant milestone in recent history, as
        many historians and experts assert that the event marks the beginning of
        a new world order, where the United States no longer holds absolute
        hegemony and instead competes for this space primarily with China and
        Russia. This suggests a world with more armed conflicts, reinforcing our
        thesis on the need for people to protect their assets globally.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The three countries mentioned as examples already have significant
        adoption of the crypto world. Brazil already has nearly 10 million
        people investing in crypto, representing a total of $2 billion. Nigeria
        is the second country with the highest crypto adoption in the world,
        with over 90 million users and $60 billion in transactions. Ukraine
        already has at least 12% of its population using crypto.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Problem</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Strategically, Speck Finance will focus its efforts on growing in the
        emerging markets mentioned above, but it is clear that the following
        problem is relevant in virtually all countries around the world, except
        for the G7 (Canada, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
        and the United Kingdom) plus China and Russia. Therefore, the next
        question applies to at least 5.8 billion people on the planet:
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        How can you safely protect and grow your wealth internationally, so as
        not to be at the mercy of local economic, geopolitical, and
        environmental instabilities?
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
        3.1 How can you internationalize your investments today?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Each country has its own peculiarities in the financial system. Let's
        take Brazil as an example, but this applies to almost all emerging
        markets. Brazil isn't the best example, as there are already some
        alternatives available. Nonetheless, let's proceed: Brazil has one of
        the best and most technologically advanced central banks in the world
        and a very prosperous fintech ecosystem. The Central Bank of Brazil
        launched the Pix in 2020, an instant and free payment system that
        operates with all banks and financial institutions in the country. The
        Pix has been adopted as the primary payment method by Brazilians,
        achieving absolute success just four years after its launch. However,
        there are many barriers when it comes to making international
        investments. Today, there are some ways to achieve this goal:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Opening an account with an international investment bank;</li>
        <li>Opening an account with an international broker;</li>
        <li>Opening an account with an international digital bank;</li>
        <li>Opening an account with a crypto exchange;</li>
        <li>Setting up an Offshore/PIC.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Almost all institutions offering this type of service have their
        headquarters in Brazil, which weakens one of the pillars of Speck's
        thesis, which is to prioritize asset protection. How can you protect
        your assets when the local government exercises direct power over these
        companies, including the ability to block their respective accounts?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Furthermore, the allocation and redemption time often takes several
        days, whereas with Speck, it is instantaneous, as we operate via
        blockchain. The costs and product range are also issues, as crypto
        brokers will not provide traditional assets and vice versa, and everyone
        charges very high allocation fees due to a restricted market with little
        competition.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Lastly, the cost to establish and maintain an offshore company/personal
        investment company (PIC) is around $3,000 per year, making sense only
        for individuals with at least $3 million in assets. Otherwise, the fixed
        costs do not justify the returns generated by the assets.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. How it works</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck Finance is a native web3 international investment platform. This
        means we only work with tokenized financial products. Our operation
        involves creating a regulatory and technological infrastructure to
        enable people from emerging markets to invest in assets from around the
        world securely with just a few clicks, with the goal of protecting,
        growing, and accessing these assets from virtually anywhere in the
        world.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">4.1 Regulatory framework</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The regulation of the crypto and tokenized assets world is being debated
        globally and is in constant change and evolution. Currently, Speck
        Finance is incorporated in Costa Rica and holds licenses to operate with
        crypto and tokenized assets. Costa Rica, besides being a crypto-friendly
        environment, has maintained a demilitarized neutrality policy since
        1949, making it a safe location to host an international investment hub
        in the region. As our client base grows, we will expand our regulatory
        infrastructure to Switzerland and Singapore, countries that also have
        advanced crypto regulation and follow a neutrality policy, which we
        consider essential for providing security to our users. In this way, we
        will create an international regulatory network to handle operations of
        any nature and achieve an intersection between the crypto world and the
        real world, so that beyond asset allocation, protection, and growth, our
        clients can access these services almost anywhere in the world.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
        4.2 Technology Architecture
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Initially, Speck will not create its own products; we will act solely as
        an intermediary for existing products. We have built a web2/web3
        infrastructure where the user signs up, undergoes a Know Your Customer
        (KYC) process, completes an investor profile questionnaire, and is
        assigned an investment consultant to their account. Once this is done, a
        screen is made available displaying all current offerings. Upon
        selecting a product, the user can pay with fiat currency or crypto, and
        their investment is executed instantly through our blockchain-based
        platform.
      </p>

      <img src={Graph4} alt="Inflation3" className="mb-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Assets Curation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A major value proposition of Speck is the curation of assets. Today, in
        the crypto world, considering only what is available on exchanges, there
        are at least 30,000 assets available. Our team of specialists is
        responsible for selecting assets, conducting a fundamental analysis to
        understand the team behind the project. If it passes our scrutiny, we
        initiate our graphical analysis to start buying and selling. After a
        maturation period, where we buy and sell the asset in question, if it
        shows interesting performance and has a complementary characteristic to
        the assets already listed within Speck, we then make it available on our
        platform.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck always intends to maintain itself as a clean environment where our
        clients will find quality products with relevant returns, without
        worrying about falling into scams or empty assets.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Fragmentation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Today, there are many quality assets for which the minimum investment
        amount is inaccessible to most people, with minimums reaching up to $5
        million. Since we work exclusively with tokenized assets, we will be
        able to purchase assets with high minimum investment requirements and
        fragment them into smaller, more accessible pieces within our platform.
        This allows us to democratize access to these premium assets, making
        them available to a broader range of investors.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
        7. Unification / Creation of own products
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A step beyond curating and fragmenting assets is the creation of our own
        products by combining existing ones into a composition that suits the
        client's profile. As the allocation volume within Speck begins to grow,
        we will have sufficient information and data to understand what our
        audience likes to buy the most. This will enable us to create tailored
        baskets that not only simplify investments but also provide a more
        personalized and efficient user experience, streamlining the investment
        process.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. Fees</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck's revenue is generated from fees that vary depending on the
        products and can change. We have a specific pricing table for this,
        which outlines the different fees applicable to our services. The
        possible fees charged include:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>On/off ramp transaction fees;</li>
        <li>Management fees;</li>
        <li>Performance fees;</li>
        <li>Subscription.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Speck Finance aims to be a global platform for crypto, tokenized assets,
        and DeFi, specifically designed for individuals from emerging markets
        who face challenges such as local economic instability, inflation, and
        currency depreciation. By constructing a robust regulatory and
        technological infrastructure, we ensure that our clients can securely
        save, protect, grow their assets, and access them from anywhere in the
        world without the risk of being hacked or falling into scams. Our
        primary challenge is to build trust and establish recognition, so that
        people view Speck as an innovative solution for international investing,
        providing a safe and reliable way to diversify and grow their wealth
        globally.
