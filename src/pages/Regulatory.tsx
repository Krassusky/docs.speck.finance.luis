      <p className="mb-4">
        The regulation of the crypto and tokenized assets world is being debated
        globally and is in constant change and evolution. Currently, Speck
        Finance is incorporated in Costa Rica and holds licenses to operate with
        crypto and tokenized assets. Costa Rica, besides being a crypto-friendly
        environment, has maintained a demilitarized neutrality policy since
        1949, making it a safe location to host an international investment hub
        in the region.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        As our client base grows, we will expand our regulatory infrastructure
        to Switzerland and Singapore, countries that also have advanced crypto
        regulation and follow a neutrality policy, which we consider essential
        for providing security to our users. In this way, we will create an
        international regulatory network to handle operations of any nature and
        achieve an intersection between the crypto world and the real world, so
        that beyond asset allocation, protection, and growth, our clients can
        access these services almost anywhere in the world.
